# jumphelper

This is a local service which you can use to query i2p jump services but only as
needed, with rate-limiting and a place to experiment with privacy-enhancing
measures, like limiting the overall and remotely deducible uniqueness of a local
addressbook while not compromising it's ability to be defined by the local user.

By the way, don't use it yet unless you read it. It's not finished.
