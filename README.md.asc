# jumphelper

This is a local service which you can use to query i2p jump services but only as
needed, with rate-limiting and a place to experiment with privacy-enhancing
measures, like limiting the overall and remotely deducible uniqueness of a local
addressbook while not compromising it's ability to be defined by the local user.

If you want to test it, that's fine, but it's highly experimental.

## GOALS:

### Service/Library goals

  * Make it more difficult for an eepSite with embedded resources from remote
  sites to reliably determine the long-term contents of a user's address book
  by rate-limiting requests to the local addressbook.
  * Make it easier for third-party, non-core i2p applications to create their
  own, per-application address books. This will allow them to construct address
  books based on what they need to contain and configure per-application how
  the addressbook should work.
  * Obviate my earlier project [*thirdeye*](https://github.com/eyedeekay/thirdeye)
  by implementing a simpler AddressHelper service(than thirdeye) that can be
  forwarded over i2p and treated like an AddressHelper.

### Feature Goals

  * Allow the users to configure multiple "master" AddressHelpers, and create
  a way to arrive at a "consensus" based on what they report and longitudinal
  data.
  * Enable automatic **signed** updates using public keys to authenticate
  accounts associated with desired hostnames to create a "Dynamic DNS" type
  setup. This might be useful for services driven by the API, which could change
  destination frequently.
